## Guides

**Creating a product vision:**  
What problem are my target users currently experiencing?  
What would help alleviate this problem?  
How will my product provide this form of problem alleviation?  
What does a “happy user” look like?  

**Creating a customer journey map for key user personas:  **
Who would be buying my product? How old are they? What is their professional background? What are their motivations (both personal and professional)?  
What problem are my buyers currently experiencing?  
How would they come across my product as a solution?  
What problems would they face when either trying to purchase my product, or implement it in their business?  
What would success from our product look like from our buyer’s perspective?  

**Creating a user experience flow:**  
Where do you want your users to land?  
What is the “hook” that will stop them from bouncing on your page?  
Do you need different landing pages for different types of users?  
How can you capture their contact info so your sales team can follow up on a lead?  
Are all the steps necessary? Can you cut any out to streamline the flow and increase conversion rate?  
Is there a clear and obvious way for the users to purchase the product?
